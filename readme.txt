2. A random secret word will be chosen from the wordlist and then the number of letters will be desplayed on your screen and a sequence of blanks (underscores) will be desplayed for you too.
3. You can guess only 1 letter per round. 
4. After you input your guess you will be told if your guess was correct or incorect. 
5. You will be able to view on your screen how many guesses you have left. 
6. You will have a total of 5 mistaken guesses.
7. The game will end in one of two ways: 

   -If you have guessed all the letters in the secret word, you win.
   -If you run out of guesses before determining the secret word, you lose.
